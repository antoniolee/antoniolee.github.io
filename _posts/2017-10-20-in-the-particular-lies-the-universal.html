				Everyone has a story. So, I guess I should share one of mine?<br><br>

				Instead of writing some bullshit, it's time to get personal. Letting go of your insecurities and being vulnerable will connect you to your audience.<br><br>

				... <br><br>


				When I was younger, I thought I was cool. I thought I was cooler than everyone. I've had many friends who I've basically abandoned for popularity or other social purposes. In the moment, I felt like I never had a choice. But looking back now, I know I could have handled things differently.<br><br>

				I'm sorry.<br><br>

				... <br><br>

				To be honest, maybe I would have never changed. But I had the same thing happen to me. During my freshmen year of college, I met another group of dudes who I thought were cool. I basically kicked it with these guys everyday; chillin, playing fifa, sharing songs on soundcloud. <br><br>

				I felt at home. <br><br>

				Then one day, one of the guys who I thought was my friend decides that I'm not allowed to hang out at his place anymore. And just like that, all the friends who I thought were my friends, weren't. Long story short: I never kicked it with any of them again.<br><br>

				... <br><br>

				Sometimes humans are mean. Sometimes the more you get hurt, the more you want to shell away.<br><br>

				... <br><br>

				After a couple weeks, I stopped feeling sorry for myself. The image you portray will attract a certain type of audience. I was trying to portray myself as a certain type of "cool". The "cool" guy with a hot girlfriend. The "cool" guy who gets invited to all the parties. The "cool" guy that shits on losers. The "cool" guy that a lot of people want to be. <br><br>

				In middle school and high school, I thought that was what I was supposed to do. I thought that being cool meant I had to get a nice car, a "cool" job, a fake ID, be able to drink a lot, be able to smoke a lot, get invited to all the parties; basically everything that all the "cool" kids were screaming at me to do. <br><br>

				... <br><br>

				But that's not me. Now I'm the guy writing about a particular moment, hoping to shed some light. <br><br>

				What we think are our most particular and personal moments, actually turns out to be our most universal and relatable. It took me a while to realize being "cool" is not what made me unique, special, or better than anyone. <b>Be authentically you.</b> <br><br>

				... <br><br>

				In the particular, lies the universal. <br><br>
