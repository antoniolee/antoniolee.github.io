				Everyone has a story. So, I guess I should share mine?<br><br>

				Instead of writing some bullshit, it's time to get personal. Letting go of your insecurities and being vulnerable will connect you to your audience. <br><br>

				... <br><br>

				So let's get personal. <br><br>

				... <br><br>

				When I was younger, I thought I was cool. I thought I was cooler than everyone. I've had many friends who I've basically abandoned for popularity or other social purposes. Sometimes I felt like I never had a choice but looking back you know you could have done something differently.<br><br>

				I'm sorry homies.<br><br>

				And now here I am reflecting on all the friendships abandoned, while I'm alone at a conference with +10,000 people. <br><br>

				To be honest, maybe I would have never changed. But of course everything comes full circle and I had the same thing happen to me. In college, I hung out with another group of dudes that I thought were cool. I basically kicked it with these guys everyday; partying, playing fifa, sharing songs on soundcloud. <br><br>

				I felt at home. <br><br>

				Then one day, one of the guys I thought was my friend decides that I'm not allowed to hang out at his place anymore. And just like that, all the friends who I thought were my friends, weren't.<br><br>

				... <br><br>

				Sometimes humans are mean. And sometimes the more you get hurt, the more you want to shell away.<br><br>

				... <br><br>

				After a couple weeks, I stopped feeling sorry for myself. The image you portray will attract a certain type of audience. I was portraying myself as a certain type of "cool". The "cool" who tries to be cooler than you. The "cool" who shits on losers. The "cool" guy whose life looks so "cool". <br><br>

				In middle school and high school, I thought that was what I was supposed to be. I thought that being cool meant I had to get a nice car, get a cool job, get a fake ID, be able to drink a lot, be able to smoke a lot, get party connections, party super crazy; basically everything that all the "cool" kids were screaming at me to do. <br><br>

				But that's not me. Now I'm the guy writing about a particular moment, hoping to shed some light.<br><br>

				... <br><br>

				In the particular, lies the universal. <br><br>
