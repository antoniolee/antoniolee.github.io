            <h4>October–December 2018</h4>
            <p>Slalom is a business and technology consulting firm. Clients often don’t know about Slalom or what services they offer.
                Currently, sales executives are having difficulty with the traditional sales approach of presenting
                information in the form of PowerPoint decks to potential clients. </p>

                    <p>We started our discovery by identifying pain points and areas of opportunity with the traditional approach to sales.

                    <h4>Taking an iterative approach to design</h4>
                    <p>
                        We created lo-fi wireframes in Sketch and made interactive prototypes using InVision to quickly test and iterate based off of real user feedback with our team of sales executives. 
                        <!-- By iterating our designs based off of real user testing, we were quickly able to identify what worked and what didn’t for our sales executives. -->

                    <div class="img-description">
                        <p class="img-title">Lo-fi clickable prototype</p>
                        <p>
                            For the lo-fi prototype, the intent was to validate an experience that would trump the
                            traditional approach to sales. Attempting to show a potential client a sales deck is a
                            completely different approach than being able to casually show someone a picture or article
                            through your phone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For sales executives to use this tool as a conversational tool, we had to determine how to
                            structure
                            content in such a way that allowed for dynamic storytelling to replace the linear format of
                            slide
                            decks.

                        <p>
                            For the hi-fi prototype, we continued to polish the experience based off of user testing.
                            There
                            was now a request to tailor the visuals to Google. With the possibility that this tool will
                            scale to other clients in the future, we had to keep in mind solutions that were client
                            agnostic
                            versus those specific to Google.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With the hi-fi clickable prototype created, we waited to hear the results from one of
                            our
                            sales executives using the hi-fi prototype in the wild.

                        <p>
                            The proof of concept was a major success. Based on the feedback we heard, it seemed that we
                            were onto something. Our sales executives were itching to be able to have the fully functional experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After the proof of concept was completed, our resources from the Experience Design practice
                            were spreading thin. Our UX analyst started a new engagement and we had to switch project
                            managers a number of times.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From this point, I was asked if I could take ownership to design and develop a functional
                            prototype that could meet our MVP goals. We focused our efforts on creating a clickable prototype for a tablet device, so we did not have the full responsive experience in place. I stepped up and took on the challenge to design and develop mobile and desktop experiences while launching the functional prototype for sales to use.

                            Imagine you are in the parking lot having an interesting conversation with some at work
                            about solving a problem. They happen to be a sales executive and next thing you know they
                            are trying to show you slide deck on their laptop.
                        </p>
                        <p>No one wants to see a sales deck.</p>

                        <p>
                            By designing a responsive website experience, we enabled our sales executives to display
                            material on all devices, casually. The ability to frame the situation for the potential client from
                            viewing a presentation to having a conversation was powerful.

                            People are willing to look at an article on your phone and have a quick conversation.

                        <p>Sales executives had difficulty showcasing all the projects Slalom had completed for Google
                            from
                            a
                            holistic standpoint. There was no formula for highlighting past work we’ve done with clients.
                            With
                            inconsistent messaging, the narratives being presented could vary or be incorrect.</p>

                        <p>
                            We created an interactive project timeline to show projects in a format to help sales
                            navigate
                            quickly amongst projects while telling the overall story.

                        <p>
                            We also created a template for project case studies to present information in a consistent
                            manner,
                            highlighting project overview, business challenges and the results provided.

                            Google is just one of many clients. With the success of this project, there was a request to

                            By separating the client specific needs from the ones that are client agnostic, we were able
                            to
                            design the core features in a way that were agnostic in terms of design or content.

                    <h4>What I learned from this experience</h4>
                    <p>
                        We take the ability to create digital products for granted sometimes. By creating a tool
                        to replace the traditional sales approach, Slalom sales executives have had real-world results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There have been stories of Slalom sales executive using the tool in action in parking-lot
                        situations
                        almost daily. There are even accounts of sales executives saying that they landed a gig because
                        the
                        tool spoke directly to the client and quickly addressed a need.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had some doubts that we might have been over-engineering an experience, when we could have
                        used other interactive presentation software and save some of our Experience Design
                        practice
                        resources, but the results don’t lie. The new businesses opportunities being granted out-weigh
                        the
                        effort from our end.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Next steps</h2>
                    <p>
                        With such wild success with the sales enablement tool, we decided to invest further resources
                        into creating a scalable version of this tool. In the future, Slalom will be able to spin up
                        tailored web experiences for any one of their clients.
