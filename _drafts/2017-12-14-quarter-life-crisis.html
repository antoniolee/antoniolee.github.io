				I feel like I'm having a quarter life crisis. Tbh, whenever I come to Maui, I have a some sort of ephiphany, that turns into me realizing I'm kind of in some shit. Like some sort of a funk. It's really wierd. <br><br>

				At first I made up excuses like, "maybe I'm just too young" <br><br>

				... <br><br>

				But lately I've been starting to realize that my problems haven't changed.<br><br>

				I think if you change your environment, even if it were to go on a simple walk (I read that somewhere), you start to think differently. I realize I haven't been doing shit with my life lately besides work. I don't even work on shit for myself, which is what I really want to do. <br><br>

				And this shit doesn't count. This is basically the same kind of shit I say to myself on a daily basis, but now it's written down so you and I can read it. Cool huh? <br><br>

				... <br><br>

				Anyways. I'm in Maui with my aloha shirt on. It's cold. DJ Love is spinning the ones and twos tonight at DTH. But I think I might go to sleep. I'm tired. <br><br>

				Goodnight, sweet dreams. Till next time... <br><br>
