				It's really trippy to see planes taking flight. <br><br>

				Like if you really look, it almost looks unreal. It's basically a car with wings, with a turbo sized engine. It goes kinda fast, like around 70 mph, then all of a sudden the thing takes flight. <br><br>

				Watching that makes you wonder, how safe is this thing?? It'd be really ironic if this was my last flight, but I believe it won't be. It isn't easy to fly a plane, but that's okay. We're kind of wired to overcome the most difficult situations. <br><br>

				- knocks on wood - <br><br>

				Hopefully when I look back at this writing I'll have a laugh.
