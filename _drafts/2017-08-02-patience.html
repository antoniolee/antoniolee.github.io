				Patience: The capacity to accept or tolerate delay, trouble, or suffering without getting angry or upset. <br><br>

				When I read the definition, I realize I lack patience. I wish it was like a video game item, where I could pull it out and, "BAM!", I got some patience to use. <br><br>

				But that's not how it works sadly.<br><br>

				The philosophers weren't lying when they said "patience is a virture".<br><br>

				I may have been getting caught in this whole "authenticity" crisis. I feel like for most of 2017, the word "authentic" was my word. I felt that authenticity was everything. I dove head over heels, trying to become... authentic. Whatever that means. <br><br>

				And I think that was my first mistake. It's not really authentic to try and be authentic... It has to come naturally, as corny as that sounds. And that's why the new word for the rest of 2017 is now: patience. <br><br>

				I think I've been in turmoil with who I am. I like somethings about me, I don't like somethings about, I love somethings about me, I hate somethings about me... And that's just that way we humans are. I should start writing horoscopes for millenials. <br><br>

				... <br><br>

				Focus, have patience, and you will find what you want.<br><br>
