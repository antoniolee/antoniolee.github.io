				The easiest way to get to where you want to be is to form a great team. Some people believe that there is a magic formula to team building. To me the formula is simple; work with people who want to do the same thing as you.<br><br>

				But that alone is really tough. Very rarely do you find a team where the focus for every team member is in unison. People work differently. Also people work differently by themselves, with one team member, or as a whole group. <br><br>

				... <br><br>

				Teams are tough. No matter the size, working with other humans to get a task accomplished is not as easy as it sounds. There will be fights, there will be arguments, there can be jealousy and there can be deceit. Trust doesn't come easy when working with others. <br><br>

				... <br><br>

				But trust me, when you accomplish a task with a team, you will feel more feelings than doing something alone.
