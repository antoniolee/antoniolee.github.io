				So I just read that… &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
				“Happiness can only come as the unintended side-effect of pursuing a cause greater than yourself. Purpose trumps passion always.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
				Hmm… Do you agree? Author continues to say…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
				“When your why is strong enough, you’ll be willing to do whatever it takes. You need a cause you truly believe in. You’ll be willing to figuratively throw yourself — or your feelings — under the bus.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
				I feel that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
				Continues with…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
				“It’s not about you. It’s about the cause. It’s about your purpose, which is far greater than you.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
				Also feel it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
				“You don’t have to have “a box.” Let go of your imagined self-concept. Who you really are cannot be defined. Forgot what you think you are. Instead, follow your fears wherever they take you. They point the direction. Expose yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
				Be who you want to be, not who your fears define you as. Live for a purpose bigger than yourself, something you believe in your bones.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
				…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
				Let go of your imagined self-concept. Think about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
				… &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
				Stick to the game plan. Things are working out, but stick to the plan. You can get comfortable living a life that is comfortable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
				Face your fears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
				Explore the unknown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
				Aim for the stars, and reach out to your dreams.

				Begginings are all sorts of kinds of things. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

				They can be great, they can suck, they can be scary, they can be easy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

				Then they can turn out to be shitty, or super awesome, or really easy or really hard. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

				They can be all screwy sometimes and fuck you over. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

				...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

				But you have to do it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

				You have to start. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

				If you don’t, you won’t get to do all the things you want to do in life. If you wait forever, you’ll miss your chance. So you have to take risks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

				The beggining of this whole writing thing is going to be all of the above. I don’t really know what I’m doing, but I know I have to do something instead of nothing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

				I’ve wrote to myself before that your voice is one of the best tools. We don’t use it enough. Whether it be in the form of writings, videos, or real time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

				The time for me is now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

				...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

				So this is to a new beginning, and hopefully a brighter future. Whoever is reading this, go out and try to start something new. And no, I don’t mean start a new relationship...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

				... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

				I mean create something new. Do something new. Do what excites you. Most of the things I like to do in life were once way out of reach. You have to start somewhere to get where you want to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

				So why not start now? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
