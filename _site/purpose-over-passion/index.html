			<h1>Purpose Over Passion</h1>
			<p>Most of the things I like to do in life were once way out of reach.&lrm;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="right">
			<p>
				So I just read that… <br><br>
				“Happiness can only come as the unintended side-effect of pursuing a cause greater than yourself. Purpose trumps passion always.”<br><br>
				Hmm… Do you agree? Author continues to say…<br><br>
				“When your why is strong enough, you’ll be willing to do whatever it takes. You need a cause you truly believe in. You’ll be willing to figuratively throw yourself — or your feelings — under the bus.”<br><br>
				I feel that.<br><br>
				Continues with…<br><br>
				“It’s not about you. It’s about the cause. It’s about your purpose, which is far greater than you.”<br><br>
				Also feel it.<br><br>
				“You don’t have to have “a box.” Let go of your imagined self-concept. Who you really are cannot be defined. Forgot what you think you are. Instead, follow your fears wherever they take you. They point the direction. Expose yourself.<br><br>
				Be who you want to be, not who your fears define you as. Live for a purpose bigger than yourself, something you believe in your bones.”<br><br>
				…<br><br>
				Let go of your imagined self-concept. Think about it.<br><br>
				… <br><br>
				Stick to the game plan. Things are working out, but stick to the plan. You can get comfortable living a life that is comfortable.<br><br>
				Face your fears.<br><br>
				Explore the unknown.<br><br>
				Aim for the stars, and reach out to your dreams.
