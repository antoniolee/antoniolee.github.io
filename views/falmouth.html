					<strong>Falmouth</strong> was a menu re-design for a AAA video game (Disclosed due to NDA). I created designs by reiterating on (disclosed topic). The goals were to increase ease of use, ease of learning, and enhance overall gameplay experience. The project was split into three phases: Discovery, Ideation, and Design Production. Project was achieved by creating a design that decreases number of screens and number of button presses, while effectively hitting all of the goals.
