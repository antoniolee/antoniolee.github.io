		<p class="droid-sans" style="font-size: 14px"> My name is Antonio Lee and I'm an aspiring web/mobile developer & designer. I recently graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz, where I majored in Computer Science with an emphasis towards Game Design. Now that I've graduated, I've been taking the time to hone my skills with programming, art and design. One day I want to do a start up with friends, but my current goal is to become a great developer &designer.

		Besides designing and developing, I like to do other things! I love skateboarding, cooking & eating awesome food, traveling/adventuring and meeting awesome people from all around the world.
